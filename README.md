## Usage

This package exposes a single class `AutoretouchClient` allowing high and low level interactions with the autoRetouch API.
In most cases, you would like to process images according to some workflows within the scope of an organization.

Once you copied your `organization_id` from (https://app.autoretouch.com/organization) > Copy Organization ID.

To refer to a workflow, retrieve the workflow id at: https://app.autoretouch.com/workflows > â‹® > Workflow API Information > id.

Example to upload an image and process it through a workflow:

```python
# ...
organization_id = "e722e62e-5b2e-48e1-8638-25890e7279e3"
workflow_id = "26740cd0-3a04-4329-8ba2-e0d6de5a4aaf"

input_image_content_hash = client.upload_image(image_path="input_image.jpg", organization_id=organization_id)

workflow_execution_id = client.create_workflow_execution_for_image_reference(workflow_id=workflow_id,
                                                                             image_content_hash=input_image_content_hash,
                                                                             image_name="input_image.jpg",
                                                                             mimetype="image/jpeg",
                                                                             labels={"myLabel": "myValue"},
                                                                             workflow_version_id=,
                                                                             organization_id=organization_id)

workflow_execution_status = client.get_workflow_execution_details(workflow_execution_id=workflow_execution_id,
                                                                  organization_id=organization_id).status

if workflow_execution_status == "COMPLETED":
    result_image_bytes = client.download_result_blocking(workflow_execution_id=workflow_execution_id,
                                                         organization_id=organization_id)

    with open("result_image.jpg", "wb") as f:
        f.write(result_image_bytes)

```
